## Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

**However, the following additional condition applies to this project:**

### Additional Condition

No one is allowed to copy, modify, or distribute this project under any condition. If found copied, modified, or distributed without explicit permission, legal action will be taken.

## Terms and Conditions

### 0. Definitions

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright Holder" means the person or entity who owns the copyright.

"You" (or "Your") means an individual or a legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

"Source Code" means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object Code" means any non-source form of a work.

### 1. Source Code

The source code must be made available under the terms of this License.

### 2. Basic Permissions

All permissions under this License are subject to the Additional Condition stated above.

### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies

You may not copy or convey verbatim copies of the Programâ€™s source code as you receive it.

### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions

You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program under any condition.

### 6. Patents

You receive no rights to patents for the licensed work.

### 7. Additional Terms

Any additional terms must be consistent with the conditions of this License and may not further restrict the permissions granted here.

### 8. Termination

You may not propagate or modify any covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

This License provides a license to propagate and modify any covered work.

### 11. No Surrender of Others' Freedom

If conditions are imposed on you that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.

### 12. Disclaimer of Warranty

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION.

### 13. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### 14. Interpretation of Sections 12 and 13

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

## END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
